# GalleryDL Beyond

GalleryDL Beyond is a graphical user interface (GUI) for gallery-dl, built to provide a dynamic queue system for URLs. This was developed out of a personal need to queue URLs while browsing galleries, as using a text file was not ideal.

## Features

- Dynamic queue system
- Ability to add URLs while others are still downloading
- Displays downloaded files in a log window
- Displays downloaded URLs in a message window
- Pause and resume functionality

## Installation

To install GalleryDL Beyond, you must have Python 3.7 or higher and pip installed on your system. Then, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install -r requirements
```

For a more controlled environment, this application requires a configuration file in the same directory as the project or the executable. An example configuration file is provided in the config_example directory, which sets the following:

- Creates and uses a `downloads` directory for all downloads.
- Creates archive and cache SQLite databases in the `bin` directory.
- Replaces some invalid characters that were causing problems.
- Restricts download speed to 1 MB/s.
- Sets other download and output configurations.

The application also expects a binary of gallery-dl, which can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/mikf/gallery-dl/releases). As this application was primarily developed for use on Linux, it has not been tested or configured to work with other binaries besides `gallery-dl.bin`. To make this application portable, it is necessary to provide the binary instead of relying on it being installed on the system.

Run the app with:

```bash
python app.py
```

## Release build

To create a self-contained application (currently only available for Linux), run this command:

```bash
pyinstaller app.py
```
